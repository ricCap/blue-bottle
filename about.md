# BlueBottle
We started this project in April 2021 as an experiment to meet an have the opportunity discuss interesting topics and share ideas. We tried presentations, games, structured and unstructured discussions, with small (5) and bigger (15) groups of people. The project keeps evolving. The core five of us meet weekly and many are still on the radar to join interesting presentations and discussions. While the format and the objectives change, what we managed to build together is a small solid community that shares valuable content daily. If you feel like knowing more about it, reach out on [Telegram](https://t.me/RicCap) or by [email](capraroriccardo@gmail.com).

## BlueBottle is...
+ A PLACE to share ideas and improve ourselves. To be better, to be different.
+ A PLACE for discovery, improvement, and open discussions.
+ A PLACE where everyone is welcome, without judging.
+ A GROUP of interesting people wanting to learn more and help each other.
+ With good structure, and no limits!
+ Where you feel better afterwards!VÃ¬
