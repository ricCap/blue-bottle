Why are we still writing resumes? Are we just re-writing our LinkedIn profile in a format that is just harder to maintain? Some thoughts about the process of maintaining an updated CV and how it might be a good idea to drop it in 2021.

# Do you still need a CV in 2021?

Let's start by saying what the difference between a Curriculum Vitae (CV) and a resume is: a CV contains your whole academic and work history (LinkedIn is your CV), while a resume is a shorter summary containing everything your audience needs to make a decision about you: skills, tools, knowledge, education. Your audience is your next potential employer or the person deciding whether you'll be part of that very interesting opportunity you are applying for.

Over the years I have been updating my CV multiple times, currently to 2 major versions (rewrite it from scratch) and 12 minor versions (add/remove information). Although these numbers are small, every time I do it, it requires a few hours to a few days, and a resonable amount of effort. Lately I have come to a point where I want to update my resume at least once every two weeks, and struggle with finding the time to do it. I end up having a resume that is not updated, or that does not reflect the needs of the person who is going to read it (the audience).


## My solution: resume-as-a-story
Why not writing a short resume as a compelling story of your life. A story that brings out who you are, what you have done and achieved, and how you got here.

Some suggestions:
+ Keep a bullet list of the everything you have done/achieved so far
+ Rewrite your resume every time by adding what your audience is interested in
+ Set yourself a limit (5m read)
+ Make relevant things **bold**
+ Start with WHY
+ End with WHY

## Some other tools

### Cover letter
A cover letter is a must-have for pretty much everything you do in life. Why? Because it's your first chance to state why you are intested in THEM and why they should listen to you. A cover letter is almost always required.

### Video CV
A video CV is a great way to start. It requires quite some effort to prepare, as one might not be very accustomed to speak in front of a camera. However, be assured it is going to catch people's attention. LinkedIn now allows you to upload a 30 seconds video that is going to be displayed when people click on your profile picture. It's a nice touch to say a few words about yourself and get your message across.

### Curriculum studiorum
The Curriculum studiorum contains your whole university career history: exams, marks, and courses you attended. This is particularly useful when you want to show you have some knowledge on some specific subject, or if you are starting your career and want to point out your strengths. Sometimes required.

# Conclusions
The conclusion is: no, you don't need a CV in the 21st century anymore; your linkedIn profile, your personal website, your private blog frontpage can well be the place where you collect all the information that a recruiter, sponsor or investor might need to understand what you've done and how you got here. But be sure to have a story to tell to your target every time you are ready.
